# ESM 206 (Fall 2020) - Lab Week 3

## Lab 3 skills & topics: 

### Part 1: 

Tidying continued: 

- `full_join()`: join data frames
- `pivot_longer()`: gather wide data
- `pivot_wider()`: spread long data

### Part 2: 

Exploring normality, central tendency and data spread, probabilities associated with Z-scores

### Part 3: Writing functions in R

What is a function? A function is a named bit of code that is meant to perform specific operations or tasks with user-defined arguments. 

We've already been using tons of functions! All of our wrangling has been done with functions (`select()`, `filter()`, `mean()`, etc.) - but sometimes we might want to make our own. 

To make our own function, we need to: 

1. Name it 
2. Tell it what the arguments are (choose useful names here, too!)
3. Specify the operation or tasks

### Part 5: Making your own GitHub repo, cloning to work locally, and using GitHub for project management & communication

- Create a new repo
- Clone & add a problematic .Rmd file
- Projects
- Cards
- Issues
